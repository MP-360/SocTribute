      <h2> The Jump of a Lifetime </h2>
    <p> 
      Born and raised in Gloucestershire, UK, Michael Edward's hometown and its distinct lack of ski slopes would be the first of many hurdles facing the British Olympian on his journey. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Having only started learning skiing at the age of 13, by the time he was 21, Eddie was trying (and failing) to qualify for a position on the British downhill team at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Undeterred from reaching the Olympics, two years later Eddie was in Lake Placid, NY, training in downhill conditions of a higher standard. But it didn’t take long before he ran out of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I looked for something cheaper to do, and I saw the ski jumps and I thought, 'Well, Britain has lots of alpine skiers, cross-country skiers, biathlon skiers, but we'd never had a jumper... I'll give it a go"' he told <i> The Canadian Press </i> in 2009. 
    </p>    
    <p>
    Without any form of financial support for training, Eddie worked as a plasterer to save enough money to keep his Olympic hopes alive. He was likewise disadvantaged by his weight — at about 82 kg, Eddie was more than 9 kg heavier than the next heaviest competitor. 
    </p>    
    <p>
Using his trainer's old equipment, Eddie had to wear 6 pairs of socks to make his boots fit. Most famously of all, being very longsighted, Eddie had to wear his high strength spectacles at all times. During ski jumps, his glasses often fogged to such an extent that he could not see!
    </p>
    <p>
     His hard work paid off in the 1987 World Championships when he placed 55th in the world and as the sole British contender, automatically qualified for the 1988 Winter Olympics.
    </p>
    <p>
     During the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Edwards competed in and finished last in both the 70 m and 90 m events. His lack of success endeared him to people around the globe. 
    </p>  
    <p>
        At the closing ceremony, the president of the Organizing Committee, Frank King, singled out Edwards for his contribution. King said, looking at the competitors, <i>"You have broken world records and you have established personal bests. Some of you have even soared like an eagle."</i>
    </p>
  <p>
    Eddie has since become famous for personifying the Olympic spirit and for his determination to represent his country without any form of funding. Many will remember Edwards for his thick pop-bottle glasses that magnified his eyes and often fogged up when he jumped, and his bright humour, playing along when people joked that paramedics should be on alert for his landings.
  </p>
  <p>
Eddie became a fully qualified ski instructor shortly after retiring and he still works as a ski guide today. Eddie went on the become the world number nine in amateur speed skiing, (106.8 mph / 171.9 km/h). For several years in the early 2000s, Eddie co-hosted a Sunday morning show with Trish Campbell on BBC Radio Gloucestershire. In 2003, he graduated from De Montfort University in Leicester with a degree in law.

        Held the British ski jumping record from 1988 to 2001.

       In 1991, Edwards completed a charity ski jump at a ski slope in Christchurch, Dorset. He raised £23,000 for BBC Children in Need by jumping over 10 cars using a ski jump made of scaffolding.

       Following the 1988 Games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) instituted what became known as the Eddie the Eagle Rule, which requires Olympic hopefuls to compete in international events and be placed in the top 30 percent or the top 50 competitors to qualify.
